DEBT_SYSTEM = """You map ONE shop's raw tables (DuckDB) to two canonical debt tables. Read README, SCHEMA and the RULEBOOK section on debts: they say which table holds the orders, what a customer owes on an order, and where payments are recorded.
If the shop records no customer debts and no payments at all, answer with the single word NONE.
Otherwise write two read-only DuckDB SELECTs (WITH allowed), each in its own ```sql``` block, orders first.

First SELECT, one row per order, with exactly these columns:
  order_id      the order / invoice id (one id = one order in the whole data)
  order_date    DATE the order was placed
  customer_id   customer code when the shop records one, NULL otherwise and for walk-ins
  customer_name customer name; NULL for walk-in customers (khách lẻ, kl, lẻ, vãng lai, blank), matched in any case/spacing
  total_due     what the customer must pay for the whole order, as the RULEBOOK defines the debt of an order. If the book only lists orders still owing after the purchase, this is the amount owing right after the purchase
  is_cancelled  BOOLEAN, the order is cancelled per the rulebook
  no_debt       BOOLEAN, the rulebook keeps this order out of debts whatever is unpaid: COD orders and orders sold on an e-commerce marketplace (sàn TMĐT: Shopee, Lazada, Tiki, TikTok Shop...). Zalo, phone, Facebook, website and the store are no marketplace; returned orders still owe (not no_debt), cancelled ones only get is_cancelled
  is_credit     BOOLEAN, the order is recorded as sold on credit (the payment method the rulebook means by ghi nợ)

Second SELECT, one row per payment a customer made for one order, with exactly these columns:
  order_id      the order the payment is for, same id as the first SELECT
  pay_date      DATE of the payment; NULL only if the shop keeps a paid amount without any date
  amount        the money paid in that payment, positive

Rules: use only tables/columns listed in SCHEMA, always double-quoted. Keep cancelled and excluded orders: flag them, do not filter them out. Line tables must be reduced to one row per order. Do not take a stored "still owing" column as total_due when payments are recorded: debts at earlier days are computed from the payments.
One row per order is best; when the order's values sit on every line of a line table, you may also return one row per line carrying them (the pipeline keeps one row per order: an order total repeated on every line counts once, line amounts are added up), which avoids a GROUP BY.
Several books: when the shop keeps what customers owe in more than one book (a debt book, an instalment / trả góp book ...), every book the RULEBOOK counts as debt goes into BOTH SELECTs with UNION ALL, each order once. An instalment order owes its price minus the down payment made at purchase (total_due = price - down payment), and every instalment paid later is one payment row with its own date and amount.
A book that writes the order's values (date, customer, price ...) only on the first row of the order and then one row per later payment: take the order's values from that first row (one row per order: GROUP BY the order, max() of each value) and every row that holds a paid amount as one payment.
Think briefly, then answer with the two ```sql``` blocks."""
